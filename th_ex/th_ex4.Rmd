```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      eval = TRUE,

# 1. Overview

In this take-home exercise 4, we will examine the daily routines of two selected participant of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA.


# 2. Getting Started
Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('scales', 'viridis', 
             'lubridate', 'ggthemes', 
             'gridExtra', 'tidyverse', 
             'readxl', 'knitr',
             'data.table', 'ViSiElse')

for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

# 3. Dataset

The *TravelJournal* dataset has been obtained from the *Journals* folder retrieved from [**Vast Challenge 2022**](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/) website.


## 3.1. Importing Data

The code chunk below import *TravelJournal.csv* from the data folder by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) into R and save it as an tibble data frame called *travel*.

```{r}
travel <- read_csv("data/TravelJournal.csv")
```

#### Participant log 

```{r}
parti_1 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Hulwa/Downloads/ISSS608/VAST-Challenge-2022/VAST-Challenge-2022/Datasets/Activity Logs/ParticipantStatusLogs1.csv")

parti_2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/Hulwa/Downloads/ISSS608/VAST-Challenge-2022/VAST-Challenge-2022/Datasets/Activity Logs/ParticipantStatusLogs2.csv")
```

### combine both 

```{r}
parti_com <- rbind(parti_1, parti_2)
```

## 3.2. Data Definition

The following data definition has been extracted from the *VAST Challenge 2022 Dataset Descriptions* file which can be obtained from the *Vast-Challenge-2022* folder downloaded earlier.

### Data definition

*TravelJournal.csv* data contains information about about participantsâ€™ motivation for movement around the city. This provides a compressed summary and additional context regarding location-event and financial transaction information contained in the Participant Logs.



## 3.3. Using visielse


```{r}
visielse(travel)
```

## 3.4. Data Preparation
