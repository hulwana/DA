# 1. Overview

In this take-home exercise 4, we will examine the daily routines of two selected participant of the city of Engagement, Ohio USA.


# 2. Getting Started
Before we get started, it is important for us to ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.

The chunk code below will do the trick.

```{r}
packages = c('tidyverse', 'lubridate', 'patchwork', 'RColorBrewer', 'ggthemes', 
             'ggiraph')
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```

# 3. Dataset

The *TravelJournal* dataset has been obtained from the *Journals* folder retrieved from [**Vast Challenge 2022**](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/) website.


## 3.1. Importing Data

The code chunk below import *TravelJournal.csv* from the data folder by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) into R and save it as an tibble data frame called *travel*.

```{r}
travel <- read_csv("data/TravelJournal.csv")
```

## 3.2. Data Definition

The following data definition has been extracted from the *VAST Challenge 2022 Dataset Descriptions* file which can be obtained from the *Vast-Challenge-2022* folder downloaded earlier.

### Data definition

*TravelJournal.csv* data contains information about about participants’ motivation for movement around the city. This provides a compressed summary and additional context regarding location-event and financial transaction information contained in the Participant Logs.

● participantId (integer): unique ID corresponding to the participant in question

● travelStartTime (datetime): the time when the participant started traveling

● travelStartLocationId (integer): the unique ID corresponding to the location
the participant is leaving when they begin to travel, NA if unknown

● travelEndTime (datetime): the time when the participant concluded their travel

● travelEndLocationId (integer): the unique ID corresponding to the location the
participant is traveling to

● purpose (string factor): a description of the purpose for the recorded travel, one of:
{“Coming Back From Restaurant”, “Eating”, “Going Back to Home”, “Recreation (Social
Gathering)”, “Work/Home Commute”}

● checkInTime (datetime): the time when the participant checked in to their
destination

● checkOutTime (datetime): the time when the participant left their destination

● startingBalance (double): the participant’s starting balance at the beginning
of their travels

● endingBalance (double): the participant’s ending balance at the conclusion of
their travel

## 3.3. Data Structure and Summary

The following codes are executed to reveal the structure and summary statistics of the data:

```{r}
str(travel)
```
